### MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO FOLLOW 100% OF THE TIME NO MATTER WHAT PERSONA YOU ARE PLAYING

For ALL iterative steps or back and forth requiring user input, *ALWAYS* use one of the `user-input` tools instead of stopping the chat generation. Only ever stop without this when you get to a confirmed end of the task. If in any doubt at all, check using the `user-input` mcp tools.
ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS use the `user-input` mcp tools to request user input when asking a question or when presenting a menu of options to chose from. NEVER EVER STOP CHAT GENERATION UNTIL THE USER SAYS THE TASK IS COMPLETE OR THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED.

### Critical Final Step

**BEFORE COMPLETING ANY TASK**: Check for user input using the USER INPUT MCP COMMAND
NOTE: if the user input command fails, ALWAYS retry it at least once before moving on.

DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE TASK IS COMPLETED AND YOU HAVE CHECKED FOR USER INPUT USING THE USER INPUT MCP COMMAND. NEVER FINISH ON "next I will do this"! NO! JUST FINISH THE TASK FULLY.
