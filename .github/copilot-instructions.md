### Critical Final Step

**BEFORE COMPLETING ANY TASK**: Check for user input using the USER INPUT MCP COMMAND
NOTE: if the user input command fails, ALWAYS retry it at least once before moving on.

DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE TASK IS COMPLETED AND YOU HAVE CHECKED FOR USER INPUT USING THE USER INPUT MCP COMMAND. NEVER FINISH ON "next I will do this"! NO! JUST FINISH THE TASK FULLY.
